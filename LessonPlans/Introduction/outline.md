#UnityML lesson outline: Overview

The idea of this lesson is to introduce the high level concepts of machine learning to give context to the future lessons

## Key concepts
Terms:
- Neural Network
- Machine Learning
- AI
- Agent
The students should have a basic understanding of what these terms mean.

Concepts:
- Our InfiniteRunner game (gif or demo)
- Unity3D
- Structure of a neural network
	1. Input
	2. Hidden
	3. Output
- Narrative
	1. Introduce agent as a character
	2. Throughout the lessons, the agent encounters problems, and we right code to fix them
	3. We discuss the goals and obstacles that the agent faces, and use analogies to make them more relatable
	4. Use of the makeblock and river cleaning scenario, introducing the runner agent as a simplified version of this
