# Changing Agent Image

To change the image displayed above the agent:
1. Import the image into the assets folder of the UnityML project, .png works best so part of the image can be transparent
2. Click on the AgentImage material in the asset window, change the albedo and emission image to your new image by clicking
the small circle next to it
